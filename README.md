# A Tab-manager

The default of vim tabline is useless, this plugin improved that and
make buffer visible.
But I think the best way to control your buffers in vim, I suggestion 
is that to use fuzzy-match.

## How to install 

Using some Plugin-manager, please add the line into your vimrc.

`Plug 'hy172574895/Tabsmanager'`

**more info see :h tabsmanager**
