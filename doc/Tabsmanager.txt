*Tabsmanager_Introduction*

The default of vim tabline is useless, this plugin improved that and
make buffer visible.
But I think the best way to control your buffers in vim, I suggestion 
is that to use fuzzy-match.
##How to install 
Using some Plugin-manager, please add the line into your vimrc.
`Plug 'hy172574895/Tabsmanager'`

*Tabsmanager_default_mapping*

`tt`        
    Open a Tabsmanager window when there is not. If there is, 
    then point to Tbasmanager window. If cursor on Tabsmanager 
    windows then back to last window.
    you can change this mapping by setting g:tabmanager_mapping_tt

`tg`
    Jump to tabs, this function will let you type an exactly numbers
    to jump.
    you can change this mapping by setting g:tabmanager_mapping_tg

'tb'
    Control a buffer, this function will ask you to type twice, the
    first one will confirm that the style to show buffer, the 
    second one is the numbers of buffer that you want to control.
    you can change this mapping by setting g:tabmanager_mapping_tb
    
    the following is the style of the first type:
        't' Open buffer in new tab.
        'b' Open buffer in curren buffer
        's' Open buffer splitly
        'v' Open buffer vertically

The following mapping is only works when cursor on tabmanager window:

't' open curren buffer in a new tab.
'o' open curren buffer in curren buffer.
's' split curren buffer in curren tab.
'v' split curren buffer verically in curren tab.
'p' point to the buffer.
'd' delete buffer.
